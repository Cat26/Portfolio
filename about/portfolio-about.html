    <h3>Hello my name is Julia</h3>
    <p>
        I graduated from two faculties of Biology and Computer Science (Bachelor), which proved to me that nothing in life is impossible.
        I like new challenges and the most important thing for me is to do what I love.

    <h3>My Experience</h3>
    <p>
        My first job as young developer was in the Financial industry where I was responsible for writing tasks automation scripts in Python.
        Next I tried my hand as Devops and finally I was able to decide what Is my way and became Javascript developer.

    <h3>My hobbies</h3>

        I like spending free time on both programming and drawing.
        I'm also interested in graphics design so I'm trying to combine all those passions in my projects.
